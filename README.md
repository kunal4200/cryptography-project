Steganography is a method of hiding secret data, by embedding it into an audio, video, image or 
text file, called a carrier or data carrier, more specifically. It is one of the methods employed to 
protect secret or sensitive data from malicious attacks. Cryptography and steganography are both 
methods used to hide or protect secret data. However, they differ in the respect that cryptography 
makes the data unreadable, or hides the meaning of the data, while steganography hides the  existence of the data. The pixels are ever so slightly added with a little bit of information that  barely changes the look of the picture. In image Steganography â€“ The image selected for this  purpose is called the cover-image and the image obtained after steganography is called the stegoimage. A novel data hiding technique based on the Edge embedding technique and LSB (Least Significant Bit) technique of digital images is the aim of the project. Moreover, traditional AES 
encryption will be performed as well to add another layer of security
